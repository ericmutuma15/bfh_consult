# This project is a full-stack medical consultation app with a FastAPI backend, React (Vite) frontend, and Android compatibility. The backend exposes endpoints for patient onboarding, consultation requests, doctor assignment, and Daraja (M-Pesa) payment integration. The frontend should consume these endpoints and provide a multi-step consultation flow. All code should be clean, modular, and production-ready.
